**Information Collection and Use**

The Application collects information *when you opt in* to data collection via Posthog and Sentry. This information may include information such as

- Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)
- The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages
- The time spent on the Application
- The operating system you use on your mobile device

When you choose to opt-in to data collection via Posthog and Sentry, the Application collects your device's location, which helps the Service Provider determine your approximate geographical location and make use of in below ways:

- Geolocation Services: The Service Provider utilizes coarse location data (GeoIP2/Posthog) for analytics. The median error is approx 2.6km in the USA.
- Analytics and Improvements: Aggregated and anonymized location data helps the Service Provider to analyze user behavior, identify trends, and improve the overall performance and functionality of the Application.

The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.

For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that the Service Provider request will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy policy.

For the data collection of these two Third-Party Services, as well as for Google AdMob and RevenueCat, we refer to their privacy policy.

**Third-Party Services Used in Our App**

To improve your experience, ensure app security, provide functionality, and support the operation and monetization of our app, we utilize several third-party services, some of which may process personal data. The following outlines the purpose and data usage for each integrated service:

Google AdMob  
We use Google AdMob to display advertisements within our app. AdMob collects device and usage information to deliver relevant ads, prevent fraud, and report ad performance. This may include IP addresses, advertising IDs, and analytics on ad interactions, which help us monetize the app while maintaining compliance with Google’s policies. [THEIR PRIVACY POLICY CAN BE FOUND HERE](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en).

Sentry (EU hosted)  
Sentry is an application monitoring and error-tracking tool. It helps us identify and resolve technical issues by collecting data on app crashes, software bugs, and performance problems. Sentry may process technical information such as device type, operating system, and error logs to ensure service reliability and security. Our Sentry instance is hosted in the EU to better align with regional data protection requirements. [THEIR PRIVACY POLICY CAN BE FOUND HERE](https://sentry.io/privacy/)

RevenueCat  
RevenueCat manages in-app purchases and subscriptions. It processes data such as purchase history, receipts, and user identifiers to handle payment processing, subscription management, and to provide you with access to paid features. RevenueCat uses secure storage and is based in the United States, ensuring both operational effectiveness and regulatory compliance.

PostHog (EU hosted)  
We use PostHog as an analytics platform to understand how users interact with our app and improve its usability and performance. PostHog collects aggregated usage statistics (such as feature usage, session lengths, and navigation flows). Our deployment is EU-hosted, ensuring your data remains within the European Economic Area and is subject to EU data protection laws. [THEIR PRIVACY POLICY CAN BE FOUND HERE](https://posthog.com/terms)

For each service, personal data is only collected and processed for the stated purposes, based on legitimate interest, contractual necessity, or—where required—your explicit consent. Where possible, data is stored and processed within the EU, and transfers outside the EU are safeguarded with appropriate legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses or adequacy decisions.

You may contact us at any time to exercise your data subject rights, including access, rectification, erasure, or objection to processing as set forth in the GDPR.

**Opt-Out Rights**

The use of Sentry and Posthog services within this application is strictly on an opt-in basis. By choosing to enable these services, you consent to the collection and processing of telemetry and analytics data as described in our privacy policy.

You retain full control over your data and can opt out of these services at any time. This can be done by disabling the relevant settings within the application or by uninstalling the application entirely using the standard methods provided by your device or application marketplace.

Should you choose to opt out, data collection through Sentry and Posthog will cease immediately, ensuring your privacy preferences are fully respected.

**Data Retention Policy**

The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. If you'd like them to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please contact them at felix.digitallabs@proton.me and they will respond in a reasonable time.

**Security**

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information the Service Provider processes and maintains.

**Limitation of Liability**

Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-08-01

**Your Consent**

By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.
